/*	This is the grid classes, applied to WordPress-specific markup. Unfortunately WP isn't always consistent about its grid classes - Gutenberg grids have a class of "has-x-columns", galleries have a class of "columns-x". Also, I need to apply breakout styling to these elements.

This should be mostly bindings - basically, figuring out what class corresponds to the generic grid container, and extending it.

So the convention here is: grid.scss contains the core logic, and grid-wp is just that logic applied to specific instances. Think of this as an add-on to the grid framework.
